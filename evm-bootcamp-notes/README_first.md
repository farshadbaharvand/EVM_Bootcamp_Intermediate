## Important Notes

- **Stay current** - Don't skip lessons as concepts build upon each other
- **Practice daily** - Hands-on coding is essential for mastery
- **Ask questions** - Use group and Discord channels effectively
- **Complete exercises** - Theory without practice won't stick

## Final Project

The bootcamp culminates with an open-ended project where you'll build whatever you want using the skills gained throughout the program. This is your opportunity to:

- **Choose your own adventure** - Build a DeFi protocol, NFT marketplace, DAO, or any other blockchain application
- **Apply all learned concepts** - Smart contracts, frontend integration, testing, and security
- **Showcase your creativity** - The only limit is your imagination and the skills you've developed
- **Demonstrate mastery** - Prove you can build a complete, functional dApp from scratch

**Examples of what you could build:**
- Decentralized exchange (DEX)
- NFT marketplace with royalties
- Lending and borrowing protocol
- DAO governance system
- Cross-chain bridge
- Prediction market
- Gaming platform with tokenomics
- Or something completely unique!
